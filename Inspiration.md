This is based on a tabletop game I started making because I was too lazy to read the Dungeons and Dragons rules, and has since become very inspired by that game, so D&D is likely the largest contributor to this idea, along with Knights of the Old Republic, which was also based on the D&D rules. Jade Empire inspired the three core stats system, and the ability creation system is inspired by the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. While I’m not entirely sure if I want it to be turn based or real time, or if I want it to be top down or isometric, I am still drawing inspiration from Diablo, various twinsticks shooters like Helldivers, and Baldur’s Gate (particularly 3).
