My first idea, which I have somewhat wanted to do for a while, is to create a video game version of a tabletop game I have made, revised, and given up on multiple times. I feel it would work best as a top-down or isometric game, similar either to Diablo or Helldivers 1. One of the main ideas I had was the ability for players to make their own abilities with certain parameters increasing the resources required to cast the ability. I would want there to be combat and adventure/story aspects to the game, so there would be a dialogue system in place. Since that system would be fairly complex for players, I would want stats to be more simple, so I would have a 3 stat system akin to Jade Empire, though I am not entirely certain what I want them to be in order for them to all matter. Ideally the game would have multiplayer, but that is something that could be outside the scope of this project and I wonâ€™t be too bothered if it is sacrificed. The tabletop game iteration, which was abandoned fairly early in development, is intended to be setting agnostic and allow players to swap between settings, but I will want to come up with at least one to consistently test this game.
